Edge cases like empty input strings or strings containing only whitespace should be handled gracefully, returning 0 in such situations.\",\n",

If the input `text` is empty or contains only whitespace, `text.split()` will return an empty list `[]`.\\n3. Create a generator expression to calculate the length of each word in the list generated by `text.split()`.\\n4. Use the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value among these lengths. Importantly, provide `default=0` to the `max()` function. This ensures that if the list of words is empty (e.g., input was an empty string or only spaces), `max()` will correctly return `0`, as there are no words to measure.\\n5.

Based on the phrasing 'alternating two numbers', it implies `d1` and `d2` can be identical (e.g., '111' would alternate '1' and '1'). The minimum length for an alternating pattern to be clearly established as `d1 d2 d1` is 3 characters.

In each iteration, the current `num` will be multiplied with the `product` variable, accumulating the total product of all numbers.\\n4.  **Calculate Length:** The length of the `numbers` input will be determined using the `len()` function. This value will be used as the divisor.\\n5.  **Divide and Return:** Finally, the accumulated `product` will be divided by the calculated `length`.

The remainders, when read in reverse order, form the binary equivalent. We will use a `while` loop that continues as long as 'n' is greater than 0. In each iteration, we calculate `n % 2` (the remainder) and `n //= 2` (integer division). The remainders will be stored in a list. 3. **Reversing and Joining**: Since the remainders are collected from least significant to most significant bit, the list of remainders must be reversed before being joined into a string to form the final binary representation. 4. **Input Validation**: Although not explicitly required by the problem prompt, a robust solution should consider non-positive inputs. For this problem, we will assume non-negative integers as is typical for 'decimal to binary' conversion. If a negative number is encountered, a ValueError will be raised.\",\n",
